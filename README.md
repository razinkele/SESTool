# SESTool

Frontend for the SES toolbox created for the MarineSABRES project

<<<<<<< HEAD
The Frontend is build in object oriented R using the R6 class system. The front end expected to run as ShinyApp and use VisNetwork as a main visualisation tool. So far the tool could read Excel files imported from KUMU and display networks using the VisNetworks library
