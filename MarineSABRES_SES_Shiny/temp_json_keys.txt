Understanding Centrality Metrics
Total number of connections (in + out). High values indicate hub nodes.
How often a node lies on the shortest path between other nodes. Important for information flow.
Average distance to all other nodes. High values indicate central position in network.
Influence based on connections to other influential nodes. Considers network structure.
Importance based on incoming links (Google algorithm). High values indicate authority.
Use Cases
Identify intervention points (high betweenness nodes)
Find key stakeholders (high degree nodes)

Response Measures Guide
Completing DAPSI(W)R(M)
Response measures (R) and Management measures (M) complete the DAPSI(W)R(M) framework by identifying interventions to address system problems.
Types of Response Measures
Regulatory:
Laws, quotas, protected areas, bans
Economic:
Taxes, subsidies, payments for ecosystem services
Educational:
Awareness campaigns, training, capacity building
Technical:
New technologies, best practices, innovation
Institutional:
Governance reforms, co-management, partnerships
Voluntary:
Certification, codes of conduct, stewardship
Intervention Points
Address root causes (most leverage but hardest)
Regulate what people do (direct but may face resistance)
Mitigate impacts (symptomatic treatment)
State:
Restore ecosystems (expensive, slow)
Prioritization Criteria
Effectiveness:
Will it solve the problem?
Can it be implemented (political, social, technical)?
Cost:
What resources are required?
How quickly will it have effects?
Co-benefits:
Does it address multiple issues?
Effective responses address feedback loops and leverage points identified in your ISA analysis.

Connection Review
Hello! I'm your AI assistant for creating a DAPSI(W)R(M) model. I'll guide you through a series of questions to build your social-ecological system model. Let's start with the basics: What is the name or location of your marine project or study area?
Great! Now, what type of marine ecosystem are you studying?
What is the main environmental or management issue you're addressing?
Let's identify the DRIVERS - these are the basic human needs or societal demands driving activities in your area. What are the main societal needs? (e.g., Food security, Economic development, Recreation, Energy needs)
Now let's identify ACTIVITIES - the human actions taken to meet those needs. What activities are happening in your marine area? (e.g., Fishing, Aquaculture, Shipping, Tourism)
What PRESSURES do these activities put on the marine environment? (e.g., Overfishing, Pollution, Habitat destruction)
How do these pressures change the STATE of the marine ecosystem? (e.g., Declining fish stocks, Loss of biodiversity, Degraded water quality)
What are the IMPACTS on ecosystem services and benefits? How do these changes affect what the ocean provides? (e.g., Reduced fish catch, Loss of tourism revenue)
How do these impacts affect human WELFARE and well-being? (e.g., Loss of livelihoods, Health impacts, Reduced quality of life)
What RESPONSES or management actions are being taken (or could be taken) to address these issues? (e.g., Marine protected areas, Fishing quotas, Pollution regulations)
Finally, what specific MEASURES or policy instruments support these responses? (e.g., Laws, Economic incentives, Education programs)
Great! Now I'll suggest logical connections between the elements you've identified. These connections represent causal relationships in your social-ecological system. You can review and approve/reject each suggestion.
