Identified Welfare Impacts:
Identify and classify the goods and benefits derived from marine ecosystems.
Identify ecosystem services that contribute to each Good/Benefit.
Identify human activities that generate pressures on the marine environment.
Identify marine processes that support ecosystem services.
Identify pressures that affect marine processes and ecosystem state.
Identify the underlying drivers that motivate human activities.
