    "Hello! I'm your AI assistant for creating a DAPSI(W)R(M) model. I'll guide you through a series of questions to build your social-ecological system model. Let's start with the basics: What is the name or location of your marine project or study area?",
    "Great! Now, what type of marine ecosystem are you studying?",
    "What is the main environmental or management issue you're addressing?",
    "Let's identify the DRIVERS - these are the basic human needs or societal demands driving activities in your area. What are the main societal needs? (e.g., Food security, Economic development, Recreation, Energy needs)",
    "Now let's identify ACTIVITIES - the human actions taken to meet those needs. What activities are happening in your marine area? (e.g., Fishing, Aquaculture, Shipping, Tourism)",
    "What PRESSURES do these activities put on the marine environment? (e.g., Overfishing, Pollution, Habitat destruction)",
    "How do these pressures change the STATE of the marine ecosystem? (e.g., Declining fish stocks, Loss of biodiversity, Degraded water quality)",
    "What are the IMPACTS on ecosystem services and benefits? How do these changes affect what the ocean provides? (e.g., Reduced fish catch, Loss of tourism revenue)",
    "How do these impacts affect human WELFARE and well-being? (e.g., Loss of livelihoods, Health impacts, Reduced quality of life)",
    "What RESPONSES or management actions are being taken (or could be taken) to address these issues? (e.g., Marine protected areas, Fishing quotas, Pollution regulations)",
    "Finally, what specific MEASURES or policy instruments support these responses? (e.g., Laws, Economic incentives, Education programs)",
    "Great! Now I'll suggest logical connections between the elements you've identified. These connections represent causal relationships in your social-ecological system. You can review and approve/reject each suggestion."
