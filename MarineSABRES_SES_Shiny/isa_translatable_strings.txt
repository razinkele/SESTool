BOT Graphs
BOT graphs show how key indicators change over time, revealing important dynamics like trends,
          cycles, delays, and tipping points in your social-ecological system.

Identified Welfare Impacts:
Identify Key Stakeholders:
Identify Welfare Impacts:
Identify and classify the goods and benefits that people derive from the marine ecosystem.
          These represent the 'W' (Welfare) component of DAPSI(W)R(M).
Identify connections where:
Identify the ecosystem services that underpin and contribute to each Good/Benefit identified in Exercise 1.
          This establishes the link between ecosystem functioning and human welfare.
Identify the fundamental marine ecological processes and functions that support ecosystem services.
          This digs deeper into the biophysical system that underpins human benefits.
Identify the human activities that generate the pressures on the marine environment.
          Activities are what people actually DO in the marine system.
Identify the pressures (direct stressors) that affect marine processes and functioning.
          Pressures are the mechanism through which human activities impact the ecosystem state.
Identify the underlying drivers - the fundamental social, economic, technological, and policy forces
          that motivate and enable human activities. Understanding drivers is key to identifying leverage points for change.

The ISA Process
These exercises guide you through creating, refining, and exporting Causal Loop Diagrams (CLDs)
          that visualize the structure and dynamics of your social-ecological system.
These final exercises focus on refining your analysis, identifying leverage points for intervention,
          and validating your findings with stakeholders and experts.
This creates the circular DAPSI(W)R(M) framework showing how drivers ultimately affect welfare.
This preliminary exercise helps you explore the full scope of your system before detailed analysis.
This preliminary exercise helps you understand the full complexity of your marine social-ecological system
          before diving into detailed analysis. It sets the context and boundaries for your ISA.
