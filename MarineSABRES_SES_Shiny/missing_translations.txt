feedback loops.
What are feedback loops?
Feedback loops are circular patterns in the system where an element eventually affects itself through a chain of causal connections. These loops are fundamental to understanding system dynamics and behavior.
Loop types:
Reinforcing loops (R):
 Amplify change in the system.
Rule: Even number of negative connections (-)
Behavior: Can create virtuous cycles (exponential growth) or vicious cycles (collapse)
Example: Species population → + Reproduction rate → + Species population
Balancing loops (B):
 Counteract change and seek equilibrium.
Rule: Odd number of negative connections (-)
Behavior: Produces resistance to change and system stabilization
Example: Fishing → - Fish biomass → - Fishing
How to use this tool:
1. Detect loops:
 Set detection parameters (maximum length, number of cycles) and run automatic detection
2. Classification:
 Review reinforcing and balancing loops found
3. Details:
 Examine individual loops and see their complete path
4. Visualization:
 See highlighted loops in the context of your full network
5. Element participation:
 Identify which system elements participate in most loops
6. Export:
 Save results in Excel or CSV formats for further analysis
Understanding the results:
Loop length:
 Number of elements in the loop. Shorter loops (3-5 elements) tend to have greater influence.
Dominance score:
 Measures how significant the loop is based on the centrality of its elements.
Element participation:
 Elements appearing in multiple loops are potential leverage points for interventions.
Understanding feedback loops: Reinforcing loops often identify areas of system growth or collapse, while balancing loops identify stabilization mechanisms or resistance to change.

Understanding Centrality Metrics
Network-Level Metrics
Proportion of actual connections to possible connections. Higher density indicates more interconnected system.
Longest shortest path between any two nodes. Indicates how far information needs to travel.
Average steps needed to reach any node from any other node.
Node Centrality Metrics
Degree Centrality
Number of direct connections. High degree = well-connected hub.
Betweenness Centrality
How often a node lies on shortest paths between other nodes. High betweenness = important bridge or bottleneck.
Closeness Centrality
How close a node is to all other nodes. High closeness = can quickly reach or be reached by others.
Eigenvector Centrality
Importance based on connections to other important nodes. High eigenvector = well-connected to other hubs.
PageRank
Google

What are leverage points?
Leverage points are nodes in your network that have the highest potential for system-wide impact when interventions are applied. These are strategic locations where small changes can lead to significant improvements across the entire social-ecological system.
Metrics Used:
Betweenness Centrality: Measures how often a node acts as a bridge between other nodes. High betweenness means the node controls information flow and can act as a bottleneck or facilitator.
Eigenvector Centrality: Measures the influence of a node based on the importance of its neighbors. Nodes connected to other important nodes score higher.
PageRank: Google
Composite Score: A combined metric that sums the normalized values of all three centrality measures to provide an overall leverage score.
How to interpret results:
High Composite Score: These nodes are your top leverage points. Interventions here can have cascading effects throughout the system.
High Betweenness: Focus on nodes that control information flow. They can block or facilitate changes.
High Eigenvector: Target nodes that are influential because they
High PageRank: These nodes have broad influence across the network and often represent core system elements.
Using leverage points for intervention design:
Prioritize interventions: Focus resources on high-leverage nodes rather than spreading efforts thinly across many nodes.
Consider node type: Different types of nodes (Drivers, Activities, Pressures, States, Impacts, Responses) may require different intervention strategies.
Combine with loop analysis: Nodes that appear in multiple feedback loops AND have high leverage scores are especially important for system-wide change.

Completing DAPSI(W)R(M)
Response measures (R) and Management measures (M) complete the DAPSI(W)R(M) framework by identifying interventions to address system problems.
Types of Response Measures
Regulatory:
Laws, quotas, protected areas, bans
Economic:
Taxes, subsidies, payments for ecosystem services
Educational:
Awareness campaigns, training, capacity building
Technical:
New technologies, best practices, innovation
Institutional:
Governance reforms, co-management, partnerships
Voluntary:
Certification, codes of conduct, stewardship
Intervention Points
Address root causes (most leverage but hardest)
Regulate what people do (direct but may face resistance)
Mitigate impacts (symptomatic treatment)
State:
Restore ecosystems (expensive, slow)
Prioritization Criteria
Effectiveness:
Will it solve the problem?
Can it be implemented (political, social, technical)?
Cost:
What resources are required?
How quickly will it have effects?
Co-benefits:
Does it address multiple issues?
Effective responses address feedback loops and leverage points identified in your ISA analysis.
