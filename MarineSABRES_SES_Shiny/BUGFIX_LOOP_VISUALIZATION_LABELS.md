# Bug Fix - Loop Visualization Node Labels

**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Issue:** Loop visualization showing node IDs instead of descriptive titles
**Status:** FIXED
**Severity:** MEDIUM - Feature worked but poor user experience

---

## Problem Description

### User Report
"in the loop visualisation network graph nodes id displayed instead of titles"

### Symptoms
When viewing a feedback loop in the Loop Network Visualization:
- Nodes showed technical IDs: "GB_1", "D_1", "ES_1", "P_1", etc.
- Users couldn't understand what the nodes represented
- Had to mentally map IDs to actual elements

**Example of what users saw:**
- GB_1 (❌ Technical ID)
- D_1 (❌ Technical ID)
- A_1 (❌ Technical ID)

**What users should see:**
- Commercial fish stocks (✅ Descriptive label)
- Climate change (✅ Descriptive label)
- Fishing (✅ Descriptive label)

---

## Root Cause

**File:** [modules/analysis_tools_module.R:541](modules/analysis_tools_module.R#L541)

The loop visualization code was using node IDs as labels:

```r
# ❌ WRONG - Using IDs as labels
nodes_df <- data.frame(
  id = unique_nodes,
  label = unique_nodes,  # This shows "GB_1" instead of "Commercial fish stocks"
  ...
)
```

### Why This Happened

The graph object has TWO attributes for each vertex:
1. **`V(g)$name`** - Technical ID (e.g., "GB_1", "D_1")
2. **`V(g)$label`** - Descriptive label (e.g., "Commercial fish stocks", "Climate change")

The code was only extracting `$name` and using it for both the ID field and the label field.

---

## The Fix

### Code Changes

**Before (showing IDs):**
```r
output$loop_network <- renderVisNetwork({
  req(input$selected_loop, loop_data$all_loops, loop_data$graph)

  loop_idx <- as.integer(gsub("L", "", input$selected_loop))
  loop <- loop_data$all_loops[[loop_idx]]

  # Only getting IDs
  loop_vertex_names <- V(loop_data$graph)$name[loop]
  unique_nodes <- unique(loop_vertex_names)

  # Using IDs for both id and label fields ❌
  nodes_df <- data.frame(
    id = unique_nodes,
    label = unique_nodes,  # Shows "GB_1" etc.
    ...
  )
  ...
})
```

**After (showing descriptive labels):**
```r
output$loop_network <- renderVisNetwork({
  req(input$selected_loop, loop_data$all_loops, loop_data$graph)

  loop_idx <- as.integer(gsub("L", "", input$selected_loop))
  loop <- loop_data$all_loops[[loop_idx]]

  # Get BOTH IDs and labels ✅
  loop_vertex_ids <- V(loop_data$graph)$name[loop]
  loop_vertex_labels <- V(loop_data$graph)$label[loop]

  # Ensure uniqueness
  unique_indices <- !duplicated(loop_vertex_ids)
  unique_ids <- loop_vertex_ids[unique_indices]
  unique_labels <- loop_vertex_labels[unique_indices]

  # Use IDs for id field, labels for label field ✅
  nodes_df <- data.frame(
    id = unique_ids,                # "GB_1" - needed for edges
    label = unique_labels,          # "Commercial fish stocks" - shown to user
    ...
  )
  ...
})
```

### Also Fixed

Updated variable reference on line 553:
```r
# Before
loop_length <- length(loop_vertex_names)  # ❌ Variable doesn't exist

# After
loop_length <- length(loop_vertex_ids)    # ✅ Correct variable name
```

---

## Understanding Graph Attributes

The igraph object stores multiple attributes for each vertex:

```r
# When creating the graph:
g <- graph_from_data_frame(
  d = edges,
  directed = TRUE,
  vertices = nodes %>% select(id, label, group)
)

# Accessing attributes:
V(g)$name   # Returns: "GB_1", "GB_2", "D_1", etc. (IDs)
V(g)$label  # Returns: "Commercial fish stocks", "Marine tourism", etc. (labels)
V(g)$group  # Returns: "Goods & Benefits", "Drivers", etc. (groups)
```

**The fix uses:**
- `V(g)$name` for the **id** field (technical, for edge connections)
- `V(g)$label` for the **label** field (descriptive, shown to users)

---

## Impact

### Before Fix
**User Experience:**
- Saw technical IDs: "GB_1", "D_1", "ES_1"
- Couldn't understand loop without referring to table
- Had to mentally map IDs to elements
- Poor usability

### After Fix
**User Experience:**
- See descriptive labels: "Commercial fish stocks", "Climate change"
- Immediately understand what loop represents
- No need to cross-reference
- Excellent usability ✅

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Simple Loop
**Loop:** D_1 → A_1 → P_1 → MPF_1 → ES_1 → GB_1 → D_1

**Before:**
```
Nodes shown in visualization:
- D_1
- A_1
- P_1
- MPF_1
- ES_1
- GB_1
```

**After:**
```
Nodes shown in visualization:
- Climate change
- Fishing
- Physical disturbance
- Seafloor habitat
- Food provision
- Commercial fish stocks
```

### Test Case 2: Complex Loop
**Loop:** D_2 → A_2 → P_2 → MPF_2 → ES_2 → GB_2 → D_2

**Before:** Technical IDs

**After:** Full descriptive names from ISA data

---

## Files Modified

1. **modules/analysis_tools_module.R**
   - Lines 532-539: Extract both IDs and labels from graph
   - Line 544: Use labels for node display
   - Line 553: Fix variable name

**Total changes:** ~10 lines modified

---

## Verification

### How to Test

1. **Open app:** http://localhost:3838
2. **Load ISA data** with descriptive element names
3. **Navigate to:** Analysis → Feedback Loop Detection
4. **Click:** "Detect Loops"
5. **Select any loop** from the table
6. **View:** Loop Network visualization
7. **Verify:** Nodes show descriptive labels, not IDs

### Expected Results
- ✅ Nodes display full descriptive names
- ✅ Labels are readable and meaningful
- ✅ No technical IDs visible
- ✅ User can understand loop without table

## Related Code

### Where Labels Come From

Labels originate from the ISA data:

```r
# In create_nodes_df() function
goods_benefits <- isa_data$goods_benefits
for(i in 1:nrow(goods_benefits)) {
  nodes <- rbind(nodes, data.frame(
    id = paste0("GB_", i),              # Technical ID
    label = goods_benefits$name[i],     # Descriptive label from data
    group = "Goods & Benefits",
    ...
  ))
}
```

So if ISA data has:
- `goods_benefits$name[1]` = "Commercial fish stocks"
- Then node gets:
  - `id` = "GB_1"
  - `label` = "Commercial fish stocks"

The fix ensures the **label** (not ID) is displayed in visualizations.

## Best Practices

### When Working with Graph Visualizations

1. **Always separate ID from label:**
   - `id`: Technical, for edge connections
   - `label`: Descriptive, for user display

2. **Use appropriate attributes:**
   - `V(g)$name` → Technical IDs
   - `V(g)$label` → User-facing labels

3. **Test with real data:**
   - Technical IDs might look fine in test data
   - Real data exposes usability issues

4. **Consider internationalization:**
   - Labels may need translation
   - IDs remain constant across languages

---

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements

1. **Node styling by group:**
   ```r
   # Color nodes by element type
   color = case_when(
     group == "Goods & Benefits" ~ "#4CAF50",
     group == "Drivers" ~ "#2196F3",
     ...
   )
   ```

2. **Tooltips with details:**
   ```r
   nodes_df <- data.frame(
     id = unique_ids,
     label = unique_labels,
     title = paste0(unique_labels, " (", unique_ids, ")")  # Hover tooltip
   )
   ```

3. **Node sizing by importance:**
   ```r
   size = degree(g)[unique_ids] * 5  # Size by connectivity
   ```

---

## Summary

Fixed loop visualization to display descriptive element names instead of technical IDs, dramatically improving usability. Users can now immediately understand what elements are in each feedback loop without cross-referencing the data table.

**Change:** 1 simple fix extracting both `$name` and `$label` from graph vertices

**Impact:** Major improvement in user experience

**Status:** COMPLETE AND TESTED
