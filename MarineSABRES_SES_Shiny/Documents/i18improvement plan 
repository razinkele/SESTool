  When You're Ready to Implement

  You can either:
  1. Execute the plan yourself using the detailed steps
  2. Ask me to implement it - just say "start implementing the i18n plan" or
   reference the plan file
  3. Review/modify the plan - we can adjust any part before starting

  The plan will be waiting for you in your Claude plans directory whenever
  you're ready! 🎯
