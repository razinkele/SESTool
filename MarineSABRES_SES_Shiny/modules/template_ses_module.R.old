# Load templates from JSON files
# Note: Templates are now loaded from data/*.json files
# This allows easier template maintenance and addition of new templates
ses_templates <- load_all_templates("data")

# OLD APPROACH (kept for reference - can be removed):
# Templates were previously hardcoded in R. Now they're loaded from JSON files.
# To add a new template:
# 1. Create a JSON file in data/ folder following the naming pattern: *_SES_Template.json
# 2. Follow either the dapsiwrm_framework or elements JSON structure
# 3. The template will be automatically loaded on app start
#
# Example JSON structures supported:
# - Format 1: {"dapsiwrm_framework": {...}, "template_name": "...", ...}
# - Format 2: {"elements": {...}, "template_info": {...}, ...}
